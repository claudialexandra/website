                            Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets
                            Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the
                            extent
                            that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated

                            From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best

                            their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it

                            Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet?
                            Pet
                            adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best
                            of
                            all, there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. For
                            instance,
                            pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a
                            breeder
                            or finding a kitten for sale from a litter. There are more benefits as well. Since pets in
                            rescues and shelters usually come from a home where the owners ran out of money, got
                            divorced,
                            or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already
                            housetrained, good with kids, or do well with other pets. People are finding out that buying
                            a
                            puppy for sale from a breeder isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the dogs and cats don't
                            leave
                            the organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet. That means less
                            stress,
                            and more savings! So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet!

                        <p>
                            Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, did we
                            just say personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or
                            family should start with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do you need
                            a dog that is low key and good with kids, or are you looking for an energetic pal who is into
                            trail running? Perhaps a cat that will get along well with others is what you need. The dog
                            rescues and cat rescues that post hundreds of local pets near you are experts at matching
                            you with a dog or cat who will love the life you can provide. This is why so many people are
                            realizing focusing on dog adoption and cat adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet search
                            process. Best of all, our website has a feature called "New Pet Alert." Simply tell us what
                            you are looking for and we will email you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've
                            made the commitment to adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten, we will email you immediately when we
                            know of a local little furry fellow who is in need of a new home!
